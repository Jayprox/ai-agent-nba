## ⚙️ How to Use Recovery
If the chat context or project progress is lost:

1. Open the file: **AI_Agent_NBA_Recovery.txt**
2. Copy either:
   - The **detailed recovery prompt** (for ChatGPT desktop use), or
   - The **emergency prompt** (for quick mobile / Copilot resume)
3. Paste it into your AI tool and say:

> “Resume from Checkpoint: Phase 7.5 → Step 2 Verified — Async + Throttle Stable (2025-11-15). Continue with Step 3 (Frontend-ready Markdown endpoint).”

The AI will immediately regain full project context and continue from the exact point of work.

## 📄 File Contents
